# BusinessCard
The Business Card Application provides a way to storing business cards via web solution methodology.
The code sample here demostrates use of ES6 syntax then compiled into ES2015 using Babel.

To see this application live, simply download the 'www' folder to a local directory project file in some IDE of your choice, then run the app.min.html file. A pictorial representation of the Business Card Application can be seen at: https://github.com/iusc13/samplecode/blob/master/bcard.JPG.

Once up and runing, the application prompts a floating-window, requesting to know if you'd like to preload user data or enter own data. If yes is selected, then click the add button to see predefined display on the screen. However, if no is selected, you must manually fill in each data-field then click the add button.
